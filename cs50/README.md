#CS50

##What?
This repo is to help me keep track of the problem sets that I go through in Harvard's CS50 course taught by David J. Malan

##Why?
This year I want to learn machine learning but, before I start I wanted to take this course to deepen my knowledge of the principles of computer science and programming in general.
