#Javascript

##What?
This repo is to help me keep track of my journey into the depths of javascript.
This repo will contain numerous notes and javascript projects which will be both web and node applications.

##Why?
I felt I had a working knowledge of javascript and some popular frameworks like jquery and angular. I set out to start learning react when I came to the realization that my knowledge of pure vanilla Javascript barely scratched the surface. So before I start learning another abstract layer like React I terrifyingly long to swim out of the shallows and into the depths oh JS.
